					<b>When traveling by train in Italy,</b> you could be on the <i>right</i> train to Venice
					and then all of a sudden learn that you are not. You could be on an island in Greece and learn
					that you are not allowed to die there (not that you would want to). You could have a 
					disagreement with a cow in Ireland or get caught up in a bizarre parade in Brussels.
					This book describes little things such as these that make traveling an adventure.</p>
					<p>
					Push the Red Button is a collection of anecdotes and stories 
					experienced by the author over years of travel. Mr. Chesnutt&#39;s dry humor and sense 
					of the absurd is what makes you feel like you are seeing the world with him.</p>

					<b>Reviews/Comments</b>
					<p>Being a traveler as well I found <i>Push the Red Button</i> very refreshing (I love the title!). 
					It brought back many memories of crazy experiences my husband and I also had over the years. 
					This is a great book for experienced travelers and may be even a better book for those just 
					starting to travel. The stories are not only descriptive of the places visited but also fun 
					to read. The author teaches you about various destinations and how to flow with the out of 
					the ordinary situations that can and will occur when traveling outside the USA. It reminds 
					you that the out of the ordinary situations can lead you to memorable and in many cases once 
					in a life time experiences. This book could also be considered a great travel guide of where 
					to go, what to see (and maybe not see), where to stay, where to eat, and how to get around 
					in various countries. It is also an easy read and doesn’t get too bogged down in the tiniest 
					of details.<br />
					<b><i>SM-Issaquah, WA.</i></b></p>

					<p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. As an avid traveler myself, I can relate to some 
					of the situations the author describes here and he has inspired me to jot down more notes 
					about my own unique and priceless ones. After all, how often will I experience a helicopter 
					rescue from the Viking Sky cruise ship in distress in high seas off the Norway coast 
					(March 24, 2019)?<br />
					<b><i>RL-Seattle, WA.</i></b></p>
					
					<p>I had so much fun reading the many vignettes of the Chesnutt travel sagas; at times laughing
					out loud. Whether swimming with sharks in Bora Bora or finding themselves on the wrong half of 
					train headed to Venice or finding some very unusual toilets through out their journey, humor 
					always wins the day. Also, we learn to always look for the Red Button.
					<b><i>NW-Key Largo, FL.</i></b></p>
					
					<p>With <i>Push the Red Button</i>, author Van Chesnutt has made a funny, informative, and delightful
					contribution to the literature of travel. More impressive, he has pushed, stretched, and 
					invigorated the travel genre. Readers who don’t want another sleepy travelogue will be much 
					impressed by Chesnutt’s compact narratives, humble humor, and unpredictability. If he and his 
					wife visit a magnificent winery, he might tell it straight. But just as often, he’ll describe 
					a journey to a town or island as a string of anecdotal misadventures in a style that recalls 
					the most amusing Wodehouse novels. Even the structure is unpredictable. Some sections are 
					arranged geographically, while one early section is devoted to the challenges posed by 
					“Things Mechanical.” <i>Push the Red Button</i> is refreshing and genuine. It reminds us that one 
					vacation was memorable for an exhibit of classic paintings, while another was made unforgettable 
					by a note from hotel management politely explaining there had been a coup on the island you 
					were visiting. Some people yearn for an interminable book on English country gardens. For the 
					rest of us, there’s <i>Push the Red Button</i>.<br />
